The game consists of two mini-games presenting different scenarios: one teaches children about the dangers of interacting with strangers, while the other portrays an aggressive father figure in a child-appropriate way.\n\nDuring testing sessions with the target audience, we discovered that the second mini-game was especially effective at initiating conversations, thereby helping therapists in their work with these vulnerable children.',
